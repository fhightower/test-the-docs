# Test the Docs!

This repository provides a testing suite for documentation built with [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/). The goal is to provide a way to test the integrity of both the documentation itself and any code snippets in the documentation.

You can see a live example of this suite being used in the [ThreatConnect developer documentation](https://github.com/ThreatConnect-Inc/ThreatConnect_Developer_Docs/tree/master/tests).
